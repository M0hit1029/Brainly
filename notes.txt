1.how delete works
Yes, exactly! Here's the flow step-by-step:

1️⃣ User clicks delete → deleteCard(id, fetchData) is triggered.
2️⃣ API request is sent → The backend deletes the content.
3️⃣ fetchData() is called → Fetches the latest data from the API.
4️⃣ setData(response.data) updates the data state in Dashboard.
5️⃣ State update triggers a re-render → React re-renders Dashboard.
6️⃣ UI updates → The deleted item disappears from the screen.

So, React updates the UI automatically because the component depends on data, and state changes trigger a re-render. 🎯🚀

=>to prevent data to get updated in shared link we have use localstorage to store initial 
    data and even tough data gets updated we do not change it if lcal storage is already occupied
